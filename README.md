# Implementation of Poset Classification in the context of Classifying Cubic Surfaces over Finite Fields


This project relies on Orbiter.

https://github.com/abetten/orbiter

Orbiter commit number 3196 or above is required.

The purpose of this project is to classify 5+1 configurations of lines 
in the projective space of dimension 3 over a finite field of order q. 

These configurations can be used to classify double-sixes, which in turn can be used to classify cubic surfaces with 27 lines.
